# Mari0-CE
***The open-source, community-driven effort to improve upon the latest version of Mari0 SE.***

Mari0 is a cross over between the classic Super Mario Brothers and the cult hit Portal. Originally developed by Maurice Guégan, from [Stabyourself.net](http://stabyourself.net/).

You can run the .love files found in the [RELEASE](https://github.com/Mari0-CE/Mari0-Community-Edition/releases/tag/1.4) section using **Löve**, which can be found here for [Windows](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-11.1-win64.exe), [Mac](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-11.1-macos.zip), [or other platforms](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/ "Use 0.11.1").

If you're looking for help or mappacks, or you made a mappack of your own, [the game's forum is here](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewforum.php?f=8). You can also find a dedicated thread to sharing user-made mappacks [HERE](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=3591).

You can find the official releases of Mari0 SE [HERE](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=4634) (note that they are unmaintained and might contain bugs/be incompatible with current mappacks).
If you think you'd prefer Alesan's Entities (a mod for Mari0 1.6 that shares many features with Mari0 SE and Mari0 CE), you can find it [HERE](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3636).
